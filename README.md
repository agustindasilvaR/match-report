 - Listing the match history of a sumonner.
 - Displaying some of the statistics for each match (champion played, game mode, match duration, K/D/A, items, result...)
 - Displaying summoner rank and win ratio for both queues (Solo/Duo and Flex)  
 - Other data: summoner level, summoner's most played champion (portrait)
